Module 15 Challenge Repo

My final JavaScript submission file is titled "logic_final.js." The files "style.css" and "index.html" have been updated as needed in order for the javascript file to run properly.

NOTE: While I left a "logic_working.js" file in the repository, I also left the file "logic.js" in the folder to show other work I put into the challenge that ended up being discarded for the final solution. I wanted to keep it on hand, however, as it was a different approach to the challenge, and my tutor (see references) did provide some insight on how to make progress in the original method(s) I attempted. I feel this is useful for futher study and could provide a secondary challenge to continue using different functions.

## References

I originally had a substantial amount of trouble understanding how to properly access the data after calling it with the API query; I was initially successfully only able to log the data into the console.

I receieved guidance and partnership from my tutor, Justin, on approaching the challenge using geoJSON formatting Leaflet documentation. This consisted of Just heavily modifying my initial code to create a framework set up for the geoJSON function, followed by guided conversation/working through the steps needed to properly implement each portion of the challenge (such as the style function, verifying markers were working properly, building the legend, etc.).

Justin was indispensable in helping me close some gaps in understanding, directing me towards the most useful documentation, and helping me see that my original efforts weren't wildly off base, but rather needed a few key missing components in order to attain forward progress.

## No Part 2

Please note that Part 2 simply contains the starter code files; due to time contraints and the desire to focus on Project 3 workload, I unfortunately do not have time this week to take on the optional Part 2 portion of this challenge.
